      <h2>who are the "sans".</h2>
      <h3>Once apon a time.
A long long time ago.
Before the ships reached our shores.
When African Kingdoms were mighty and strong.
And their kings and Queens where loved and respected.
Everytime the moon would become full, these Kingdoms would come together, to celebrate.
All the Kings and Queens would be dressed in beautiful cloth and symbolic animal skin, all unique to each other, all beautiful to the eye.
No one knew how these kings and Queens would get their clothing or who would make it for them.
But legend has it,
That with each generation a young man and young woman would secretly be picked to travel to distant lands, search in the toughest of places all to find the finest of cloth, the most beautiful of prints and the most unique of designs.
No one knew who they were, no one knew what they looked like.
Not even the royal families.
All they knew is that they were called,
The Sans!</h3>
